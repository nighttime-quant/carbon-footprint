    "This analysis can be divided into two parts.\n",
    "In the first part, the goal is to assess the status of ___worldwide CO2 emissions___ as of 2023, as well as the impact of ___various electricity production sources___ on a country's carbon footprint and how these trends evolved over time. Particular focus has been dedicated to CO2 emissions from combustion processes (in mln tons) rather than countries' total emissions, as the former are more relevant to electricity production processes.    \n",
    "In the last sections, the information from the first part is utilized to assess how the energy mix of a country can help smooth the impact of sudden movements in energy's market prices."
