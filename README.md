# carbon-footprint
This project's goal is that of modelling and predicting carbon footprint using satellite image data, 
industrial and economic activity data, policy and regulatory information as well as weather information.
Intention is to focus on the temporal aspect of the problem, in order to be able to build predictions.
Attention will be narrowed down to a restricted and economically active area of the European Union:
this allows to capture features that are not only specific to the chosen area of attention, but to
model systemic factors as well, thus allowing for these systemic features to be easily transferred
to other parts of the continent that show different specific features.

Main Data Sources are as follows:
